##What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

Pre-compiling you CSS comes with many great advantages but also with allot of disadvantages.
Compared to standard CSS, Pre-compiling Css will cancel out allot of repetition, which in turn will make your CSS file(s)
easier to work with. Personally I prefer the ordinary way because The CSS code can, and almost always will become way more
complex when working with pre-compilers. But i can imagine that a experienced web developer will find this mush easier.

###Pros and Cons?

Pre-compiling, as i said before comes with both good and bad.

###The pros are:

1. Easier to maintain.

2. Less repetitions.

3. Make calculations in you CSS.

4. Better organized.

5. Usage of variables.


###The cons are:

1. Harder to debug.

2. Greater complexity.

3. Over all longer time to build site.


##What do you think of static site generators?

Static site generators are a very good way of not repeating your self. It is also very fast. But just as pre-compiling,
static site generators requires allot of work for it to work. But overall i think it's a neat tool for small static sites.

###What type of projects are they suitable for?

SSGS is a perfect tool for those who want a small website for presenting information, such as blogs!

##What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

The internet is full of so called Scanners, they are essentialy robots that scours the internet and all its websites for
 information. For example Google uses Scanners to index websites. As a developer you have allot of power over these robots.
 all you need to do is write a robot.txt file and tell it which robots to allow and not allow to search your website.

 Personally i decided to allow Googles search engine to find my website, but i disallowed all other.


##What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

Human.txt is for us humans. If i want to find out who is the creator of a certain website and what tool they used to make
 the website.
 All i need to do is type /human.txt(considering they have whiten a human.txt) after the websites url.

 I decided to include information about what software i used and whom contributed to the site.


##How did you implements comments to blog posts

I decided to use the recommended software Discus. And i wanted to limit the things people can comment on so i decided to
 only use it on each blog-post.


##What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

Open graph is in simple word a better way to present links. each link is presented with a picture and description of what
 the link contains, such as media or websites.

 Right now i have no media or picture to link or share, so i decided that if someone wanted to link my entire page, a small
  description would appear.
