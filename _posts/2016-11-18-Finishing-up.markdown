## Head scratching

This process have made me both frustrated and happy.
I have come to realise that it is usually the case when it comes to this education. Great struggle and great reward.


### Am i finished?

No. But somewhere you have to draw a line. You can't force yourself to  understand everything at once.
I have worked hard with this project and i will continue to update the site so that is looks more like i want it.
I think that the main mission was to experiment with the tool that we where given, and apply it to our sites. I think i
have done a good job with that, but there is always room for improvement.
